# flappybird-app
This is an android game made using libgdx game-development framework.
The game uses flappybird concept from flappybird.io
I used libgdx to create the project and android studio 3.1.3 to implement it.
To import project, copy the link from clone or download and open new project from version control in AS.
You can also download the zip. Unzip the project, launch it on AS and it will download the necessary files.
